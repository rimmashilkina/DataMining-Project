Java
	The JAVA application was build and tested using Java 8 SDK and jGrasp.
	It should work with newer version of Java, but I did not test it with newer versions of Java.

	How to run the application:

	Option 1 (using jGrasp):
		1. Use JGrasp to open DecisionTree.java
		2. (Optional) Compile it
		3. Run it
	
	Option 2a (Windows command-line):
		1. Run CMD
		2. change current directory to directory where DecisionTree.class is located.
		3. Run command: java DecisionTree
	
	Option 2b (Linux, MacOS - command-line):
		1. Open terminal, i.e. bash / zsh / etc.
		2. Change directory to directory where DecisionTree.class is located
		3. Run command: java DecisionTree
